### Introduction:
Embarking on the journey of launching CoderKit, a React.js application, brought with it the daunting challenge of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This blog recounts the SEO hurdles faced and the inventive solutions employed to ensure visibility on Google.

### The SEO Conundrum:
Post-launch, the realization struck that the application wasn't making its way to Google search results. Traditional solutions pointed toward static site generators or frameworks like Next.js, but migrating the project wasn't an option. Delving into SEO implementation nuances and website essentials, initial efforts to update meta descriptions in index.html proved futile.

### Discovering the Power of Sitemap.xml:
A breakthrough emerged with the revelation of the significance of sitemap.xml. Creating a script to automatically generate this file based on known routes, devoid of dynamic backend-driven URLs, became pivotal. Configuring the Search Console to index these pages marked progress, but a notification soon arrived—indexing failure.

### Addressing Redirection Woes:
Upon inspection, the issue lay in redirection. React applications default to landing on index.html, hindering search engines from indexing individual pages. An innovative solution materialized: generating HTML pages for each known route during the pre-build phase. These pages mirrored index.html structure but contained distinct meta tags and content pulled from the route config.

### Making Redirection Seamless:
Concerns about server-level configurations were assuaged by platforms like Netlify, which inherently checked for file name matches with requested URLs. If found, they returned the file; otherwise, they defaulted to redirecting requests to index.html. This seamless redirection is crucial for React applications, ensuring that custom error components function effectively.

### Testing and Triumph:
With all configurations updated in the Search Console, the real test began. After a day, a notification arrived—success! All pages were now indexed. However, the ranking was modest due to the application's novelty. A search appended with "coderkit" yielded optimal results, but there was room for improvement.

### Conclusion:
This SEO journey with CoderKit reflects the iterative and adaptive nature of problem-solving in the tech realm. While the current approach has yielded positive results, the ever-evolving landscape of SEO beckons exploration. Feedback and alternative approaches are welcomed.

## What is CDN?

CDN stands for **Content Delivery Network**. 

A CDN is a system of multiple servers distributed geographically which works together to provide fast delivery of Internet content like HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, videos and images etc.

#### Why do we need CDN?

- It reduces latency, thus it improves the website load time. Since the contents are distributed globally, the distance between clients and the content also gets reduced, resulting in faster access to the content.

- Minimize downtime and increases availability due to their distributed nature.

- Improves website security by providing DDoS mitigation and using secured and updated  SSL/TLS certificates.

- It also helps in reducing bandwidth consumption costs of the origin server.
